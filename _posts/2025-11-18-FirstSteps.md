Proud to be an owner of a Nikon D600. It's my first time properly with a DSLR, so everything is on Auto and I'm just triggering on the shutter button now. Everything to me is the same but I'm enjoying this newfound power that I have in this camera. I hope you have as much fun looking at these pictures as I had pleasure in taking them!

See you soon!
