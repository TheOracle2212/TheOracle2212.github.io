Happy new year everyone!
I spent my new year going around the Marina Bay and surrounding area today. Total distance walked was just under a half marathon. I personally enjoyed trying to capture the Merlion from a few different angles and playing with the light. You can see them here...
A lot of very cool scenes in the surrounding areas and so much to take in. Defintely will reshoot this place again someday!
