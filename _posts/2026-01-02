Today I wanted to explore Haji Lane. It's so close - walking distance -  from Bugis, and its been on my personal radar for a while. The architecture, vibes, and culture in the area was really conducieve and the stills there really reflect that. So many small avenues, corners, shops, and scenes to play with - loved it!
Defintely worth a revisit with more friends!
