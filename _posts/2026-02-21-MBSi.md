Headed to Marina Bay Sands to sort out my iPhone at the new Apple Marina Bay Sands — ended up staying for the light.

Between the reflections, clean lines, and skyline views, it was impossible not to shoot. When the setting does half the composition for you, you just press the shutter.
Shot on my Nikon D600!
