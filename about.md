    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Arjun, a photography enthusiast exploring light, motion, and human presence.
      This site is my visual journal of moments that caught my eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I focus on capturing authentic scenes, experimenting with color and perspective,
      and sharing stories through imagery.
    </p>

      As a word of warning, this website will push your device's network connection. While these are still slightly downsampled images I've post processed, I personally refuse to deliberately drop resolution and definition in the images for slightly faster loading times - I hope you understand.
