# About Me

I shoot moments that exist between intention, accident, and passing by.

Most of my photography is observational — I prefer spending entire days in one locality rather than chasing isolated frames.

Gear:
- Nikon D600 DSLR
- Nikkor AF 55mm F2.8
- Nikkor 28-85mm
- Natural light when possible
- Time

Currently exploring long-form visual storytelling and motion blur experimentation.
